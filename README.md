# CrossingLaylines
This is the master file for ideas, scripts, transcripts and links to my podcast. An interview podcast with fictional characters in a world where magic and technology have synthezied and morphed into a new world where startups have draconic investors, cell phones are starting to expand to the fey market, and morality is starting to twist in on itself as strange new powers and combinations are making their ways into the world.
